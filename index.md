   <p>Hello everyone!<br />
My name is Diego, and Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Systems and Engineering Management at Texas Tech University. My research centers on Organizational Resilience and Engineering Education, with a particular focus on the use of multidisciplinary approaches to explore complex problems.</p>

<p>I apply methods such as the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) and the Resilience Analysis Grid (RAG) to assess resilience in higher education institutions. Additionally, I incorporate User Experience (UX) methodsâ€”like journey mappingâ€”to analyze the development of researcher identity in Ph.D. students over time.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m passionate about bridging technical and human-centered approaches to generate insights that inform both theory and practice.</p>

    <p>This site serves as a portfolio of my academic journey, research, teaching, and professional contributions. Feel free to explore and reach out!</p>
