    <p>My research centers around organizational resilience, systems engineering, and the design of educational systems. I investigate how universities can prepare for, respond to, and grow from complex challenges by applying systems-thinking methods.</p>

    <p>I use tools such as the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) and the Resilience Analysis Grid (RAG) to analyze complex interactions and uncover hidden dynamics in institutional decision-making and educational systems.</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm particularly interested in interdisciplinary research that blends engineering, organizational behavior, and higher education policy.</p>
