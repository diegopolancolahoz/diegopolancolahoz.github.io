    <p>My research focuses on organizational resilience, systems engineering, and improving decision-making frameworks in higher education. I use methods like the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) and the Resilience Analysis Grid (RAG) to study institutional adaptability and response.</p>

    <p>Through NSF-supported work, I’ve applied these methods to explore how universities can anticipate, adapt to, and grow through disruptions — offering practical, systemic tools for academic leadership and planning.</p>
