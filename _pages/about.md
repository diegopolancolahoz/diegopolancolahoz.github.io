    <p>Hello! I’m Diego A. Polanco-Lahoz, a Ph.D. candidate in Systems and Engineering Management at Texas Tech University. My academic journey bridges engineering, systems thinking, and resilience theory with practical applications in higher education and organizational assessment.</p>

    <p>Prior to Texas Tech, I earned my B.S. and M.S. in Industrial Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso in Chile. I’ve also worked as a business analyst and held teaching and research assistant roles in engineering and management settings.</p>

    <p>In both research and instruction, I value interdisciplinarity, human-centered systems design, and creating spaces for thoughtful academic collaboration.</p>
