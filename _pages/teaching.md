    <p>I believe in fostering critical thinking and bridging theory with practice. My teaching philosophy centers around creating inclusive, engaging, and applied learning environments that help students develop both technical and reflective skills.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™ve designed and delivered courses in industrial engineering, management, and systems thinking â€” both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. I am particularly passionate about student mentorship, project-based learning, and interdisciplinary instruction.</p>
