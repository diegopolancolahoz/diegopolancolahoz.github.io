    <p>I believe in fostering critical thinking and bridging theory with practice. My teaching philosophy centers around creating inclusive, engaging, and applied learning environments that help students develop both technical and reflective skills.</p>

    <p>I've taught undergraduate courses in Chile and served as a TA in graduate courses in the U.S., combining systems engineering, ethics, and leadership development in my instruction.</p>
