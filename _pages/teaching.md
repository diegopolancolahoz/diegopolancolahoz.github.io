    <p>I believe in active learning, critical thinking, and real-world application. My approach combines engineering, ethics, and systems thinking with project-based instruction and mentorship.</p>

    <p>I've taught undergraduate courses in Chile and supported graduate-level engineering courses in the U.S., always with an emphasis on inclusive, interdisciplinary instruction.</p>
